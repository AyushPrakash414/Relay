## Architecture

Relay uses a layered architecture:


Key components:
- **WebSocket Handler** â€“ manages real-time bidirectional communication.
- **REST API Layer** â€“ for control/configuration and non-real-time operations.
- **Core Engine** â€“ message routing, user/session management, persistence.
- **Storage / Broker** â€“ persistent messages, history, and scaling via broker if needed.
